                        <p class="text-start">As a New York Life Agent, I sincerely believe that most people want to do what's right: right for themselves, right for their families, and right for their communities. In fact, that's one of the reasons I joined the company back in 2015.  After 28 years working as a federal law enforcement officer,  I wanted the opportunity to work somewhere that made it easy for other people to do what was right, and more importantly, made it easy for me to do right by them.</p>
                        <p class="text-start">You can take comfort in the fact that I have been a proud resident of the Rio Grande Valley and an active member in the Harlingen, Texas community for over 21 years, and therefore have a vested interest in seeing my friends and neighbors succeed. As a loving husband of 31 years and proud parent of 4 children, I have many of the same hopes and aspirations as my clients and am happy to share with you all the resources and information New York Life has to offer.</p>
                        <p class="text-start">Depending on your needs, I can introduce you to some ways to help protect your family's lifestyle and future; or prepare for major financial events such as paying for college, saving for retirement, or caring for an aging relative. If you're wondering about my qualifications, you might find it reassuring to know that I am a licensed agent to sell insurance through New York Life Insurance Company. In addition to my 6 years of experience, I have participated in New York Life's well-known training program, NYLIC University, and have been named twice to the list NYL Council qualifications1 (iChairman's and Execuitve Council levels and 1 year qualified as MDRT membership2 in 2018, of course, my background isn't really the one that matters. To be the best possible agent, I've found that getting to know my clients – their hopes, dreams and goals for the future – is the most important first step. So if you're looking for someone that's ready to put their expertise and experience to work for you, please let me know.</p>
